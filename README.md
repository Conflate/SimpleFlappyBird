# Flappy Bird Game

The Flappy Bird Game is a simple Python game inspired by the popular mobile game "Flappy Bird." The objective of the game is to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without hitting them. The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of pipes successfully passed.

## How to Play

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python flappy_bird.py
   ```

3. Control the bird using the "Space" key:
   - Press "Space" to make the bird jump.
   - Avoid hitting the pipes to keep the game going.
   - Each successfully passed pipe increases your score.

## Gameplay

The bird automatically falls due to gravity. Press the "Space" key to make the bird flap its wings and fly upwards. The bird will descend automatically after each flap. The objective is to navigate the bird through the gaps between the pipes.

## Scoring

The game keeps track of your score based on the number of pipes you pass. Each time you pass a set of pipes, your score increases by one point. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Game Over

The game ends if the bird collides with any of the pipes or if it goes above the screen or below the ground. Once the game is over, you can restart by pressing the "Space" key.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the game, such as the bird's appearance, pipe height and gap, game speed, and more. Modify the constants and variables in the `flappy_bird.py` file to tailor the game to your preferences.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
